A forgotten thing about original DND is the consequence of time and not being automatically powered up. Bring back story telling, anthropology, history, etc.

Game also integrates context decision making similar to Choose Your Own Adventures book

Educational based on mythology, dimensions, math, science, culture, history, concepts, physics, trigonometry, geometry, calculus, chemistry, botany, herbs, forestry, etc.

Dynamically list options and allow users to submit commands to allow us to review and add for future players. The game will get "smarter" over time

Heavy lifting will be with client-side code even for data updates until it is time to save in a database.  The goal is to just use the API for "save points" rather than being forced to keep up in real-time all the irrelevant happenings.  

Dead characters can be found up to a limited time.

Encumbrence is a real thing, so bag of holding would be valuable.

Bard is handy NPC for lore and backup but can be killed.
